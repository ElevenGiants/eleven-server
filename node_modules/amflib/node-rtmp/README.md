# node-rtmp

## About

An attempt to partially implement [RTMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol) for NodeJS in pure JavaScript.
Only the messaging aspects of the protocol are of interest at this point. Streaming media is not currently a concern.

## Status

This is only in early development. Don't try and use it for anything.
I am currently struggling with Adobe's badly written specification.
