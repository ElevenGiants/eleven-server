# Node.js Slack Client Library

## Travis-CI Build Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/slackhq/node-slack-client.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/slackhq/node-slack-client)

## Description

This is a Slack client library for Node.js. It is intended to expose all of the functionality of [Slack's Real Time Messaging API](https://api.slack.com/rtm) while providing some common abstractions and generally making your life easier, if you want it to.

This code has been built to support our [hubot-slack](https://github.com/slackhq/hubot-slack) adapter. Most other functionality isn't yet supported, and documentation is minimal, at best.
